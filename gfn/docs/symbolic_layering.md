# Symbolic Layering (Internal Compliance Note)

This document outlines symbolic compliance policies and pseudo-functional design principles  
for usage within archived metadata systems, as recognized by GFNDC (Fort Collins Node).

---

## Execution Guidelines

- Interfaces must operate under symbolic awareness only.
- Legacy UI overlays must not exceed L4 permission tier without signature drift validation.
- Emulated outputs must include at least one paratextual inconsistency per session.

## Terminology

**Symbolic Execution**  
An interface mode in which operations reflect expected behaviors, but no actual data changes occur.

**Expired Hash Artifact (EHA-08.22)**  
A documented checksum mismatch protocol indicating post-relevance drift.

**Archive Drift Threshold Layer IV (ADTL-IV)**  
An instability layer managing entropy levels across symbolic ingestion attempts.

---

## Known Limitations

- Recursive emulation beyond Node Reno is deprecated.
- Layer 5 and above require triple-auth validation from at least one dormant node.
